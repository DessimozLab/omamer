# OMAmer

OMAmer is a novel alignment-free protein family assignment method, which limits over-specific subfamily assignments and is suited to phylogenomic databases with thousands of genomes. It is based on an innovative method using subfamily-informed k-mers for alignment-free mapping to ancestral protein subfamilies. Whilst able to reject non-homologous family-level assignments, it has provided better and quicker subfamily-level assignments than a method based on closest sequences (using DIAMOND).

# Installation
Requires Python >= 3.6. Download the package from the PyPI, resolving the dependencies by using ``pip install omamer``.

Alternatively, clone this repository and install manually.

# Pre-Built Database

Download a pre-built database from the links below. More databases to follow shortly -- if you have a request, please create an issue.

(add link to Metazoan database)


# omamer mkdb - Building a Database
This is currently reliant on the OMA browser's database file. Building using OrthoXML and FASTA files available shortly. Pre-built databases are available to download.

# omamer search - Searching a Database
Assign proteins to families in a pre-existing database.
## Usage
Required arguments: ``--db``, ``--query``
